<h2> Hi I'm Nick! 👋</h2> 

I am super excited to break into data analytics! For the past several months I've been binge studying various tools and putting them into practice. I'm proficient in Excel, mySQL, Tableau, and Power BI. This is just the start and I'm eager to learn the various other forms of those tools as well as advanced programming like Python and R.

My favorite challenge is utilizing SQL to dig around the data to uncover hidden trends and insights. Having started a small eCommerce store, I understand the types of business questions to ask and potential actions to take.

My goal the next 1-2 years is to learn as much as I can within the field and develop a strong analytical mindset in order to help businesses make smart data driven decisions.

<h3>👨‍💻 Project:</h3>
I really enjoyed developing this eCommerce project, from manipulating the data with SQL and presenting clear visuals with Tableau.
