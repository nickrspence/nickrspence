<h2> Hi I'm Nick! üëã</h2> 

I am super excited to break into data analytics! Over the past 8 months I've learned a variety of tools and applied them to multiple use cases. I'm proficient in mySQL, Tableau, Power BI, MS Acess, and MS Excel. This is just the start and I'm eager to master those tools even more and learn other advanced programming like Python and R.

My favorite challenge is utilizing SQL to dig around the data to uncover hidden trends and insights. Having started a small eCommerce store, I understand the types of business questions to ask and potential actions to take.

My goal the next 1-2 years is to learn as much as I can within the field and develop a strong analytical mindset in order to help businesses make smart data driven decisions.

<h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Project:</h3>
I really enjoyed developing these first two  projects.

- The first project was developed from a real dataset from Kaggle. It required quite a bit more ETL and Stack Overflow research. I particularly enjoyed employing a variety of SQL window functions to display interesting data insights, as well as creating two dashboards in Power BI.
- The second project was completed in tandem with an online SQL course. The dataset was developed with the intent of training new analysts, which allowed for some exciting and complex queries. I also enjoyed crafting unique visuals in Tableau.
