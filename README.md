<h2> Hi I'm Nick! üëã</h2> 

I am very excited to break into data analytics! I am just completing a bootcamp in analytics from UT Austin that covers all industry standard tools including SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. The focus of the course is how to utilize the tools to solve real business use cases and present the insights with intuitive visualizations.

In my personal portfolio projects, I walk through the entire analytics lifecycle from ETL and data wrangling, to interpreting the results and creating effective visuals. My favorite challenge is utilizing SQL to dig around the data to uncover hidden trends and insights. Having started my own eCommerce company, I understand the types of business questions to ask and what the actual implications are of the results. I see my ideal role as having one foot in the business problem / requirements, and being challenged to identify and use the correct analytic tools to quickly and effectively produce a solution.

My goal the next 3 years is to learn as much as I can within the field and develop a strong analytical mindset in order to help businesses make smart data driven decisions.

<h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Project:</h3>
I really enjoyed developing these first two  projects.

-  <b>[Olist eCommerce Analyses / SQL & Power BI](https://github.com/nickrspence/Olist-eCommerce-Store)</b> 
-  <b>[Maven eCommerce Analyses / SQL & Tableau](https://github.com/nickrspence/eCommerce-company-performance-analysis)</b> 

<h4>1) Olist Brazilian Store eCommerce Analyses | Tools: MySQL, Power BI, Excel<h4>
   
- This project was developed from a real dataset from Kaggle. It required quite a bit more ETL and Stack Overflow research. I particularly enjoyed employing a variety of SQL window functions to display interesting data insights, as well as creating two dashboards in Power BI.
- Dataset (Kaggle): 100k orders from 2017-18, including price, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and vendor sourcing
-	Database: Created 8-table relational database with key mapping, EER diagram, constraints
-	Extract, Transform, Load (ETL): load data infile, data wrangling, address missing values, reformatting
-	EDA: actual vs. expected delivery times, product sales over time series and location, product seasonality (bucketing case/when), top product categories (rank), vendor lead conv rates (calculation)
-	Visualization: Power BI - Power Query ETL, key mapping, dynamic dashboard, KPIs, slicers, DAX

<h4>2) Maven Factory eCommerce Analyses | Tools: MySQL, Tableau<h4>

- The second project was completed in tandem with an online SQL course. The dataset was developed with the intent of training new analysts, which allowed for some exciting and complex queries. I also enjoyed crafting unique visuals in Tableau.
- Dataset (Maven Analytics course): 32k orders from 2012-15, including revenue, cost, website sessions, website URL tracking, advertising 
-	Database: Created 6-table relational database with key mapping, EER diagram, constraints
-	EDA: product cross sell analysis, product sales over time series, website page funnel analysis, website session click through rates, organic vs. paid search
-	Visualization: Tableau - ETL, key mapping, EER diagram, dynamic dashboard, KPIs, slicers
